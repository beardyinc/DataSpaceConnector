this directory contains deployment packages for all the different deployments we might need. If e.g. a contributor wants to build a proof-of-concept, or a show-case, and they want to deploy 
their code somewhere, this is where we would (temporarily) store the deployment scripts such as terraform.

There should be one subdirectory for each deployment.
